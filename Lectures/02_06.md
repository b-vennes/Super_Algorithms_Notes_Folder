# Quick Porabability/Counting Overview

Heaps and Heapsort
- a heap is a tree with the following properties:
  - filled binary tree where the bottom row is filled from the left
  - every node is less than or equal to each of its children
- a basic heap acts as a priority queue
  - can insert elements in a random order
  - can remove them in priority order
- both insertion and deletion are O(logn) operations. Sorting is O(nlogn)
  - insert each element into the heap
  - create a sorted list by successively removing elements from the heap
- additional useful operations:
  - decrease key
  - merge two heaps

Representation of a Heap
- conceptual representation as a tree
- each parent is less than two children
- because it is a full tree, it is asy to represent as an array
  - node at position k has children at position 2k (left) and 2k+1 (right)

Heap Insertion
- view the next empty position in the tree as a target
- insert the element into the correct place in the linear path between the root and that location
  - bump down linearly as needed

Min-Heapify
- assumes that the heap is a legal heap except the root node is illegal
- compares a parent with its too children and determines the minimum value
- then swaps the parent with the smallest child and runs min-heapify on the next set of three
  - if the parent is smallest then done

Heap Removal
- remove the root node
- move the value on the farthest right of the bottom-most row to the root node
- run min-heapfy on the root node

Heapsort
- uses a heap data structure
- puts elements from a list into the heap
- pulls out into a sorted list
